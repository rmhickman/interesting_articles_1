    <h2>Kobe Bryant: Goodbye to the NBA's All-Time Asshole</h2>
    <img src="http://www.basketwallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kobe-Bryant-NBA-Legend-1920x1080-BasketWallpapers.com-.jpg">
      	<p class="Kobe">One of the best things about Kobe Bryant is that he reminds you how much you appreciate other basketball players. Unless you're a Knicks fan, watching basketball is generally fun, primarily because most basketball players are fun to watch. Stephen Curry is Tinker Bell with deep three-point range; Russell Westbrook is Mad Max on hardwood; Lance Stephenson is Four Loko in baggy shorts. Kobe, though, provides a refreshing counterpoint to all this basketball merriment, a memo that this is, after all, a job. His game was built on conflict – first with others, more recently, with his own rickety body – and it shows. He's always fighting, he's always straining, he's always weeding out any pesky mirth. Just as a passed rain cloud makes a fair weather seem fairer, Kobe makes the rest of the NBA seem like the Gumdrop House on Lollipop Lane.</p>

    <h2>5-star sensation Zion Williamson must be seen to be believed, and Kentucky basketball fans might be seeing a lot of him</h2>

      	<p class="zion">To witness Zion Williamson in person, to be close enough to hear his sneakers squeak, is to practice holding your breath — and bracing for impact — for the better part of an hour. It is to see a 6-foot-7, 250-ish-pound teenager defy both gravity and whatever preconceived notions you had about the fluidity of a body built to play defensive end in the NFL. It is to test how quickly one can retrieve a cell phone, frame a video and press record before he does something viral.</p>

    	<p>1 Slim & Husky's Pizza Beeria
      This pizza joint and neighborhood hangout in the Buchanan Arts District from Nashville natives Clinton Gray, Derrick Moore and Emanuel Reed has been drawing long lines since opening its doors mid-March. Serving up signature and build-your-own pizzas along with local beers, wine and alcoholic slushies in a space that pays homage to ‘90s hip hop and pop culture, it looks as though they have a real hit on their hands.</p>
